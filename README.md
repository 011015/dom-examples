A sample MDN app that uses getUserMedia and MediaRecorder API for recording audio snippets, and The Web Audio API for visualizations.

A tutorial explaining how it all works will be available on MDN soon.

For now, see how the MDN [MediaRecorder API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder_API) documentation is coming along, and let us know what you think!

Thanks to [Sole](http://soledadpenades.com/) for the oscilloscope code.
