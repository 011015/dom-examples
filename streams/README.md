Examples:
* [Simple Stream Pump](http://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-pump.html). This example shows how to consume a ReadableStream and pass its data to another.
* [Grayscale a PNG](http://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/grayscale-png.html). This example shows how a ReadableStream of a PNG can be turned into grayscale.
* [Simple random stream](http://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-random-stream.html). This example shows how to use a custom stream to generate random strings, enqueue them as chunks, and then read them back out again.
